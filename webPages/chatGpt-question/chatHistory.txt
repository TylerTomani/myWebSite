is there a way to target .step in css from .step-float in the following html using css 

 class="step">
        &lt;div tabindex="0" class="step-txt step-float">
    &lt;/div>
    &lt;/div>
ChatGPT said:
No, you cannot directly target .step from .step-float using only CSS because CSS selectors work in a parent-to-child direction, not the other way around (child-to-parent).

However, if you control the HTML structure, you can use the :has() pseudo-class (which is supported in modern browsers) to achieve this:

.step:has(.step-float) {
    /* Your styles for .step */
}
This will apply styles to .step only if it contains an element with the .step-float class.

If :has() is not an option due to browser support, you'd need JavaScript to achieve this. Let me know if you need a JS solution! ðŸš€
