Yes! You'll need to organize the files into a directory to properly structure your Chrome extension. Hereâ€™s how your directory should look:

arduino
Copy
Edit
google-letter-focus-extension/
â”‚â”€â”€ manifest.json
â”‚â”€â”€ content.js
â”‚â”€â”€ background.js
â”‚â”€â”€ popup.html  (optional)
Steps to Set Up:
Create a new folder on your computer, e.g., google-letter-focus-extension.
Inside the folder, create the following files and copy the respective script content:
manifest.json
content.js
background.js
popup.html (optional, only needed if you want a UI popup)
Load it into Chrome:
Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
Enable Developer mode (toggle in the top-right corner).
Click "Load unpacked" and select the google-letter-focus-extension directory.
The extension should now be active!
