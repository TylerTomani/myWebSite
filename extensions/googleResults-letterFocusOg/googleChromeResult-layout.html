        i'm trying make an extension to add to chrome that will apply my letter focus scripts, above are the html elements i
        want to target, the divs with a role="heading" are the main search results on googles, the a tage with the
        data-agch="HJ3bqe" are the heading sub results, i would love to target both so that if i press the first letter in one
        of the results the focus goes to the result, as you can see the first div with role "heading" and the span inside
        containing the text Stack Overflow... is the first result in the google search result , if i press the "S" I would love
        the focus to go there then if i press "k", it will then go to Knowing Sharing Platform, if press "r" the focus will go
        to Rest New..., basically everytime i press a letter on the keyboard the focus will go to the first element with the
        text that has that first letter, then if the same letter is pressed again it will go to the next element containing that
        letter as its first character, but, if shift and that letter is pressed it will go to the previous element and cycle
        through the page, for example if the page first opens and shift + "s" is pressed it shouldn't go to Stack Overflow... it
        should go to the bottom of the page to the last element with that letter, and continue decending through the elements up
        if shift + that letter is pressed, how can i write a script for this and make it an extension for chrome
